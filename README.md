[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019/about) is an annual Advent calendar of small programming puzzles that can be solved in any programming language. 
One programming puzzle a day is released from 1st to 25th December, divided in two parts (the second of which is unlocked after solving the first). 
Advent of Code is created by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl), and is 100% free. If you like Advent Of Code and want to support its creator, you can
donate to him [here](https://adventofcode.com/2019/support). If you want to hang out with other fellow coders, discuss about puzzles and solutions, or just have a look around, you can
